        <h2>GENERAL</h2>
        <p>
          (i) These Terms shall be governed by and construed in accordance with
          the laws of Israel, without regard to the principles of conflict of
          law therein. The parties consent to the exclusive jurisdiction of the
          courts of Tel-Aviv. The application of the United Nations Convention
          of Contracts for the International Sale of Goods or other
          international laws is expressly excluded; (ii) if any provision of
          these Terms is held to be unenforceable, such provision shall be
          reformed only to the extent necessary to make it enforceable and if
          such provision is determined to be invalid or unenforceable
          nonetheless, the provision shall be deemed to be severable from the
          remainder of these Terms and shall not cause the invalidity or
          unenforceability of the remainder of these Terms; (iii) You
          acknowledge and agree that GHURI has the right, at any time and for
          any reason, to redesign or modify the GHURI IPR and other elements of
          the Services or any part thereof; (iv) this is the entire agreement
          between you and GHURI regarding the subject matter herein; (v) GHURI
          may assign these Terms, in whole or in part, in its sole discretion.
          You are not entitled to assign or otherwise transfer the Terms, or any
          of your rights or obligations thereunder, to any third party without
          the prior written consent of GHURI. Any unauthorized assignment will
          be void and of no force or effect; (vi) nothing in these Terms shall
          be considered as granting any rights to third parties towards GHURI;
          (vii) the failure of either party to enforce any rights granted
          hereunder or to take action against the other party in the event of
          any breach hereunder shall not be deemed a waiver by that party as to
          subsequent enforcement of rights or subsequent actions in the event of
          future breaches; (viii) all waivers must be in writing. Any waiver or
          failure to enforce any provision of these Terms on one occasion will
          not be deemed a waiver of any other provision or of such provision on
          any other occasion; (ix) any cause of action arising out of or related
          to the service must commence within one (1) year after the cause of
          action accrues, otherwise, such cause of action is permanently barred.

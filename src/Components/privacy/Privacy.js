          shall cease to retain Personal Information, or remove the means by
          which the Personal Information can be associated with you as an
          individual, as soon as it is reasonable to assume that the purpose for
          which that Personal Information was collected is no longer being

          necessary for legal or business purposes. Please note that there is
          still the possibility that some of your Personal Information might be

          in some manner. In the event we share your Personal Information to the

          circumstances where the Personal Information may contain references to
          other individuals or where the request for access or request to

          about your Personal Information against access, assortment, use or
          revelation by unapproved people and against unlawful handling,
          unplanned misfortune, decimation and harm or comparable dangers.
          Tragically, the transmission of data through the Internet isn't
          totally secure. Despite the fact that we will put forth a valiant
          effort to secure your Personal Information, you recognize that we
          can't ensure the honesty and exactness of any Personal Information
          which you communicate over the Internet, nor ensure that such Personal
          Information would not be captured, gotten to, uncovered, adjusted or
          annihilated by unapproved outsiders, because of components outside our
          ability to control. You are liable for keeping your record subtleties
          classified and you should not share your record subtleties, including
          your secret phrase and One Time Password (OTP), with anybody and you
          should consistently keep up and completely answerable for the security
          of the gadget that you use.
